# I2C Bit-Banging
This is the source code for I2C bit-banging tutorials [Part I](https://calcium3000.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/i2c-bit-banging-tutorial-part-i/) and [Part II](https://calcium3000.wordpress.com/2018/03/02/i2c-bit-banging-tutorial-part-ii/).

Note that I have done my best to test what I can of the code, but as it has evolved over (sadly) several years please know that all the bugs may not have been squashed.  If you find an error, or possible improvement, please share on the comments section of either of the pages!
